# OS Setup

The main objective is to support the bellow systems:

- Mac OS
- Arch Linux
- Ubuntu (18.08)

Note this is a **personal project**, but may be extended for your custom use case.

## How it works

This project runs on top of **Deno**, an new and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. More details here: <https://deno.land/>.

The script will setup your bash configuration using your custom repository. It'll also install some programs and to your system. You can specify a `setup.yml` file to customize your choices. Check `setup.yml` of this project to see an example.

```sh
deno install --unstable --allow-read --allow-run  oss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-souza/os-setup/master/oss.ts
